# Python_Algorithms
This repository will be used for my lessons notes and code keeper from MIT Algorithm Course (Available on https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm). 

It has an pyenv virtualenviromment called ```py-algorithms```
